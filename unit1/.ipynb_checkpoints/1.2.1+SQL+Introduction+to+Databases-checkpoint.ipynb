    "# Introduction to Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "Data is everywhere. It's something you've undoubtedly heard time and time again. But it isn't just floating out in the ether without an order or structure. Instead, it gets stored in specific formats and file types. Data can be stored in spreadsheets in CSV or Excel files. For companies that generate a lot of data though, databases (and especially relational databases) are the standard way to store data. In this assignment, we'll introduce the basics of databases, covering why they exist, how they work, and how to get data out of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Database contexts\n",
    "\n",
    "The database layer (also sometimes referred to as the persistence layer) oftentimes plays a role in a broader application context. For instance, a social messaging web app would have a database storing users and their messages. Data scientists often think of the application stack in terms of three categories: operations, storage, and analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "An operational service is the part of an application that is responsible for delivering the core user experience or product. Operational services typically consist of several parts: for instance, a server and client-side application code, For instance, in a social messaging app, the operational service would be the combination of the client-side application code that users run in their browser. Such an app would need to keep track of all its users, storing their information (name, email, geolocation, etc.) and their messages to one another. In order to create and modify data, operational services leverage databases to store information. The database itself is separate from (but a dependency of) the operational system.\n",
    "\n",
    "But why use a database? Why not keep track of data in local text files on the server? There are several advantages to using databases. First, databases can be distributed across many machines and have a higher capacity than any single machine. Also, multiple users can access a remote database at the same time and access the same 'truth'. Furthermore, databases can take data from multiple sources and store all that data in a single system. Ultimately, databases are a powerful tool for formatting and organizing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Database structure\n",
    "\n",
    "A database typically consists of a series of tables, each table with its own defined schema (or organization) and a number of records, or rows. If you've ever worked with spreadsheets, this organizational pattern will be familiar.\n",
    "\n",
    "A table is a set of rows and columns populated with data. Table data is organized first into columns. Each column has a name and a data type, in addition to other configurable requirements. The term schema refers to a particular table's configuration of columns. Schemas can change over time according to developer needs, but there is a cost to modifying a schema: oftentimes this requires migrating (that is, systematically updating) existing data to support the schema changes. A good schema is tricky to define but goes a long way to enabling good analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each record (or row) in a table must conform to the table schema. Ideally, all rows of data in a table would have an entry in every field, or column, though in the real world NULL, blank fields, and N/As (not available) abound.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three basic types of tables to be aware of. First, there are raw tables. Raw tables contain simple, relatively unprocessed data. The data in these kinds of tables will most closely resemble the data originally generated by the operations services.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, there are processed tables, which are tables where some work has been done to transform the data into a more readable and usable form.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, there are roll-up tables, a specific kind of processed table, which take data and aggregate it.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Meet SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "So we've now got a picture of where databases sit in an overall application context and a high-level understanding of their structure. But at this point, we still haven't said anything about how we get data in and out of a database in order to support an application. That's where SQL (standardized query language) comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a data scientist, raw data is not inherently valuable, rather its potentially valuable, assuming that useful analytics can be applied to it to uncover some insight or enable some process. To analyze data, we need to write database queries. Queries are requests for specific parts of the database plus. We could write a query to give us the name and email address of a user with a specific ID, or we might query for a list of all users who signed up for an app after a certain date. We might also ask that our data be organized in a specific way (for instance, sorted by last name). For relational databases (that is, databases based on the tables, columns, and rows, where tables can reference one another), SQL is the common language used to write queries. We use SQL to create, retrieve, update, and delete database records.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, there are many different forms of SQL, each implemented by the particular database vendor who wrote the database you're working with. While there are meaningful minor differences between, for example, the way PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite databases handle dates, the overarching concepts are consistent across database systems. That said, when you're looking up SQL language features be sure you're looking at the documentation for the particular database you're using. For this course, we'll use PostgreSQL, one of the modern relational databases. Later in the course, when talking about big data, we'll focus on another form of SQL, HiveQL, which is particularly useful for big data projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "When thinking about querying, it's useful to know that SQL tends to see the world in terms of rows. We will want to work in terms of attributes and characteristics that exist at the row-level. We can do some grouping and aggregation (for things like sums or averages), but that grouping again must be done with row level characteristics. We'll get into the nuts and bolts of database queries in the next assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also of note is that tables in a database will also often have an index. Querying with that index will allow things to run much faster as you can search just on that column rather than on the entire table. We'll talk a bit more about indexes and query performance in the big data section of this course."
