    "In this assignment, you will learn how to locally install and configure Postgres. We provide instructions for Mac and Windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Mac setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Go to the Postgres download site and click Download the installer for EnterpriseDB.\n",
    "Select the most recent stable release (which should be the topmost one) for MacOS.\n",
    "postgres for mac\n",
    "\n",
    "After downloading, find the .dmg file on your local machine and double click it to run it.\n",
    "Choose the default options when the installer runs.\n",
    "You'll be asked to provide a password for the Postgres user, which is the default superuser for Postgres (i.e., the user who has all admin privileges for the database).\n",
    "Be sure to make a note of the password you choose, as you'll need it later.\n",
    "It may take a minute or two for the installation to complete.\n",
    "When it does complete, you may be asked to run StackBuilder to download and install additional tools. Choose No.\n",
    "Once the installation is complete, open spotlight on your Mac and find pgAdmin. pgAdmin is the graphical interface for Postgres, and it comes with your Postgres installation.\n",
    "pgAdmin will open in a browser on the Mac as follows:\n",

    "# Windows setup\n",
    "Go to the Postgres download site and click Download the installer for EnterpriseDB.\n",
    "From the installer options, select the most recent version and Windows x86-64 for operating system.\n",
    "postgres windows download\n",
    "\n",
    "After it downloads, double-click on the installer in your download folder.\n",
    "Choose the default options when the installer runs.\n",
    "You'll be asked to provide a password for the Postgres user, which is the default superuser for Postgres (i.e., the user who has all admin privileges for the database).\n",
    "Be sure to make a note of the password you choose, as you'll need it later.\n",
    "It may take a minute or two for the installation to complete.\n",
    "When it does complete, you may be asked to run StackBuilder to download and install additional tools. Choose No.\n",
    "Once the installation is complete, go to your start menu, you should see pgAdmin Icon. It is the graphical interface for Postgres. Click to open the application.\n",
    "Create a database with pgAdmin\n",
    "On the left side of the pgAdmin dashboard, if you click on the Servers, it will ask you for a password. Use the password you created when you were installing Postgres.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you type in your password, you will see that it shows you all the information about your databases. If you click on PostgreSQL under servers, it shows you the databases that you have. You can see that a database called by postgres is already created there for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create a database and load some data into the database. We will use pagAdmin's interface to do this. Note that if you have a very large dataset, you will have to use your terminal and use psql commands to create your database and load your data. For now, we'll use a dataset small enough to work within pgAdmin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a database called BikeShare by right-clicking on the Databases -> Create -> Database on your pgAdmin window. Give your database the name BikeShare and keep the default postgres as the owner.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using the schemas found in this Bikeshare.zip file to populate the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Download the file and unzip it. It should have four schema files in it: station.sql, status.sql, trips.sql, and weather.sql.\n",
    "\n",
    "Back in your pgAdmin dashboard, right-click on the BikeShare database and select Query Tool...\n",
    "\n",
    "query tool in pgadmin\n",
    "\n",
    "Click on the open file icon, and it should open a file chooser box. Find the location where you downloaded and unzipped the schema files. Choose the weather.sql file and click select.\n",
    "Click on the Execute/Refresh icon. The query should run successfully.\n",
    "schema file\n",
    "\n",
    "You should get a Query returned successfully... message after the file executes.\n",
    "query result example\n",
    "\n",
    "In the query tool, try a few SQL queries to see if your database was created successfully. For example, run\n",
    "select * from weather;\n",
    "It should show you the content of the table weather.\n",
    "another query result example\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, execute trips.sql and station.sql.\n",
    "Note that the status.sql is a very large file (close to 1GB). If you try to load this data using the Query tool, it may not work. Follow the instructions below to load the status data into the status table.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Loading large datasets into your database\n",
    "\n",
    "At a certain size (roughly >= 500 megabytes), pgAdmin's query tool feature gets unreliable. In that case, use the create SQL command to create the table using the query tool and then use the psql to load the large dataset into your database. You can also create the table and insert the data into the table at the same time using the psql command.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open the terminal on your computer\n",
    "Using the command line cd into the folder where the status.sql file is stored.\n",
    "Enter the following command to open the Bikeshare database as the postgres user.\n",
    "psql -U postgres -d BikeShare -f status.sql\n",
    "It may ask you to type your password for the database user. This is the password that you created when you installed Postgres.\n",
    "It should successfully create the status table and load the data into the table. Be sure to go back to pgAdmin dashboard and verify that the table is there."
