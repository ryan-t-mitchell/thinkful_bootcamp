    "SVM is a powerful tool that is useful in a wide variety of contexts. However, there are two things to be careful of with this modeling approach: it is somewhat of a black box when operating in high dimensions and complex kernels can make it slow to run. In general, however, it is a reasonably accurate modeling option for both regression and classification. The ability to define a margin also allows for creating acceptable error for training in the regression context, a useful feature when you decide that's how you'd like to model your data."
