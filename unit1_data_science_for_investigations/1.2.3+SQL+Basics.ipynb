    "# SQL Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "We're now ready to begin learning SQL statements for creating and querying (that is, looking for data in) database tables. As a data scientist, database queries are the foundation on which much of your work will rest: in order to analyze and model data, you first need to get the right data, and SQL provides a rich set of statements that can be combined to precisely specify the data you want to retrieve from a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The CREATE clause\n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier when you initially installed and set up Postgres, we came across the terms schema and table. A database schema is a formal statement in SQL about how the tables and columns for a database are set up. A database contains one or more schemas, which in turn contain tables. Schemas also contain other kinds of objects, including data types, functions, and operators. The term schema can also refer to a particular table's configuration of columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a new table in your database, you use the CREATE TABLE clause. The syntax for creating a table looks as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE TABLE table_name (\n",
    " some_column_name TYPE column_constraint,\n",
    " some_other_column_name TYPE,\n",
    " yet_another_column_name TYPE\n",
    ");\n",
    "You need to specify the name of the table after the CREATE TABLE clause. To avoid any issues with creating tables, follow a few good conventions:\n",
    "\n",
    "#Use lowercase for table names.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don’t use spaces in table names. If you have more than one word for a table name, combine them using an underscore (_). For example, lower_case_and_underscore\n",
    "Postgres has some oddities around naming identifiers (such as table names) in quotes and non-quotes. Suffice to say: Avoid using double quotes in your table names!\n",
    "Use meaningful table names and be consistent.\n",
    "If you want to know more about identifier naming conventions, refer to the Postgres documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lines after the CREATE TABLE table_name statement configure individual columns. Each column has a name (following the same conventions as we used for table names). Each column also must list its type (to be clear, TYPE above is just a placeholder, you would need to use an actual type like TEXT or INTEGER.\n",
    "\n",
    "At a minimimum, each column must have a name and a type, but it's also possible to add constraints to columns such as making values in a column unique for the table, or probiting null values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The individual column creation lines in our SQL statement get separated by a comma (and a new line, but this is not strictly speaking necessary, it's a convention that ensures readability).\n",
    "\n",
    "Postgres includes a large set of built-in data types. Depending on the data that will be stored in the columns, you have to choose the correct data type for the data. You can also define your own data type, but with the rich data types that are provided by Postgres, there is often not a need for defining your own data type. Also, you will notice that sometimes the data types are written in UPPER CASE. It is not mandatory but a convention that the keywords (SQL statements, data types etc.) are written in lowercase and identifiers (table names, operations etc.) are written in lower case. When creating a table schema, you should consult this Postgres data type table to choose the correct data type for your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous lesson, you created the BikeShare database using table schemas provided to you. Now that you know more about tables Open the weather.sql in either pgadmin or your favorite code editor (e.g., VC code, xcode, textmate etc. ) and see if you can understand how the create statement for the weather table is written.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The SELECT and FROM clause\n",
    "\n",
    "The select clause retrieves rows of data from a table. The select clause includes: a select statement and a from statement. A minimal SQL query can be made with just these two clauses:\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT * FROM someTable;\n",
    "This query retrieves all columns and rows from someTable. It's saying \"Give me all of the values for each of the columns for each row in someTable\".\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also be specific about which columns we want:\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT col1, col2, anotherColumn FROM someTable;\n",
    "Let's try a simple one on our Bikeshare database. We will create a query to retrieve the names of the stations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In pgAdmin, right click on your Bikeshare database and select Query Tools.... Then run the following query.\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "    name\n",
    "FROM\n",
    "    stations;\n",
    "This query will the name value for each record in the stations table.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the SELECT and FROM keywords are all caps. These days we have fancy text editors with syntax highlighting features that make code easier to read. SQL comes from an era before syntax highlighting was a thing and SQL keywords are conventionally written in all caps to make it easier to differentiate keywords and have more readable code. This convention persists through today. Your SQL will run just fine no matter what capitalization you use, but it enhances readability if you use the capitalization.\n",
    "There are a few more options we can use here to make even these basic queries a little easier to execute. First, we can alias columns. This refers to referring to the underlying column name in the DB by an alternate name in our database query.\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "    name station_name\n",
    "FROM\n",
    "    stations;\n",
    "This can be more verbosely written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT \n",
    "    name AS station_name\n",
    "FROM\n",
    "    stations;\n",
    "Column aliasing is particularly useful when you need to query across multiple tables that contain common column names. For example, two tables may each have a column named \"id\", and we need the \"id\" values from both tables. Renaming is also valuable when using functions, a more advanced concept to cover later.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also worth mentioning * here. Many times writing a query means you inherently only want some of the information in a given table. On occasion, however, you want all of the columns present. Rather than typing out every specific column name, SQL gives you the option of using the traditional wildcard of * to select all columns. It would look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "    *\n",
    "FROM\n",
    "    stations;\n",
    "That will return the entire station table. Selecting an entire table is pretty safe when working with small tables like this one, but be careful using this on larger tables. Sometimes it will just be far too much data, and your query can hang. Also, note that when using * there is no way to alias columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Filtering with WHERE\n",
    "\n",
    "On their own, as we've seen, the SELECT and FROM clauses allow us to query some or all of the values for all of the rows in a table. But what if we are interested only in rows meeting a particular condition? For instance, we might want to see all of the orders that reference some specific customer's customer id. Or we might be interested in banking transactions before a certain date.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where the WHERE clause comes in. The WHERE clause lets us specify a set of conditions about how the records we're interested should look. WHERE clauses give us the ability to check if one or more conditions are the case, using comparison operators (=, >, >=, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "The LIKE operator can be used to use pattern matching when analyzing string data.\n",
    "\n",
    "BETWEEN can be used to check if a value is between a set of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "And of course, there's always good ole AND and OR let us link together filter conditions in a WHERE block.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Ordering with ORDER\n",
    "\n",
    "ORDER BY allows us to control the order in which data is returned. You can order by one or more columns, specifying either ascending or descending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following example, we retrieve the trip ID and start date for each trip record in our trips table that where the bike_id column's value is 27 and the zip_code column's value is 94107. In the ORDER BY clause, we say that we want this data sorted by the value of the duration column, in descending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "    trip_id,\n",
    "    start_date\n",
    "FROM\n",
    "    trips\n",
    "WHERE\n",
    "    bike_id = 27 AND\n",
    "    zip_code = 94107\n",
    "ORDER BY duration DESC;\n",
    "\n",
    "-- These are comments, by the way. Use two dashes for single-line comments.\n",
    "Run the above statement in your query tool. Note that our conditions here rely on the fact that the columns bike_id and zip_code are numeric. If you were matching on strings, you would have to compare with a string, which would be enclosed in single quotes ('). You might also find the LIKE operator useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how the above query might look if we wanted to add a constraint such as subscriber type, which is stored in the database as a string:\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "    trip_id,\n",
    "    start_date\n",
    "FROM\n",
    "    trips\n",
    "WHERE\n",
    "    bike_id = 27 AND\n",
    "    subscriber_type LIKE 'Customer'\n",
    "ORDER BY duration DESC;\n",
    "Unlike Python, strings in SQL cannot use double quotes. Keep all your SQL strings using single quotes. Accidentally using double quotes is a common mistake when writing SQL and will give you fun errors.\n",
    "Limiting with LIMIT\n",
    "The limit clause — LIMIT — allows us to limit the number of returned results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's add a limit to an earlier query. Let's get the three longest trips in our table:\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "    trip_id,\n",
    "    start_date\n",
    "FROM\n",
    "    trips\n",
    "WHERE \n",
    "    bike_id = 27 AND\n",
    "    subscriber_type LIKE 'Customer'\n",
    "ORDER BY duration DESC\n",
    "LIMIT 3;\n",
    "Formatting conventions for SQL queries\n",
    "SQL is one of the more readable computer languages. By following some common voluntary but recommended stylistic conventions, you can optimize for readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some pointers:\n",
    "\n",
    "Put each column name in a select clause on its own line, with one level of indentation from the preceding line.\n",
    "Follow the same indentation logic for FROM, WHERE, and ORDER BY blocks, giving each element its own line.\n",
    "Similarly, each clause gets its own line.\n",
    "Use all caps for clauses, function names, and the like.\n",
    "Use the actual case of the column/table name when referring to column and table names.\n",
    "Be consistent in your own use of casing, but recognize that SQL is not case sensitive, and it doesn't actually care about tabs and newlines.\n",
    "So the following line will execute, but it's not very readable, and for larger queries will be impossible to thoughtfully debug. You should avoid writing queries in this manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "select trip_id, start_date from trips where bike_id=27 and zip_code=94107 order by duration desc limit 3;\n"
